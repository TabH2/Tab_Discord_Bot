# Tab's Scripts
This is a simple discord bot using Node.JS and Discord.JS. It's a very simple bot with two commands, a mute command and a .mn command. The .mn command is a command which will change your nickname in all discord servers the bot is in. If you have the manage_nickname permission the bot will then allow you to change other users nickname's using the .mn @user command and that will change that user's nickname to a specified nickname to all servers that the bot is currently in. It has a mute command as well, what it does is you need to input the cateogry ID into the index.js and when you run the .mute command, it will create a new channel in the category called muted-(username of person muted) and will also remove all the user's current roles and give them the "Muted" role.
